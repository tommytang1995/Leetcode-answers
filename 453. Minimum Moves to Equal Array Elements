Let me explain why x = minNum + m
our goal is :increment minNum to be equal to maxNum

No matter how many add operations are executed,the goal won't change.
Every time we do the add operation,the min number in the array must participate in.
After an add operation,the minNum is still the min number
So the minNum participate in every add operation
So x = minNum + m

len*(min+k)=sum+k*(len-1).
==> k=sum-min*len;

public class Solution {
    public int minMoves(int[] nums) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int sum = 0;
        for(int num : nums){
            sum += num;
            min = Math.min(min, num);
        }
        return sum - min * nums.length;
    }
}
