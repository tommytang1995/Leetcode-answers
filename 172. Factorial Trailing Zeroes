// n/x means between 1 to n the number of the multipliers of x.
// The multiplier of 2 is always more than that of 5, so we only need to count the number of 5 between 1 to n.
// The multiplier of 5 contributes one 0, that of 25 contributes two 0s, .....
// So first we count the number of multipliers of 5, some of among which are the multipliers of 25, or 125...
// Then we count the number of multipliers of 25, one 0 has been added during the last step.
// Then we count the nubmer of multipliers of 125, two 0s has been added during the last step.

We just count the number of 5 in Equation 1.
Multiple of 5 provides one 5, multiple of 25 provides two 5 and so on.
Note the duplication: multiple of 25 is also multiple of 5, so multiple of 25 only provides one extra 5.
Here is the basic solution:
return n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + n/625 + n/3125+...;
