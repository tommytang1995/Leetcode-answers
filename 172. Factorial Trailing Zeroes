// n/x means between 1 to n the number of the multipliers of x.
// The multiplier of 2 is always more than that of 5, so we only need to count the number of 5 between 1 to n.
// The multiplier of 5 contributes one 0, that of 25 contributes two 0s, .....
// So first we count the number of multipliers of 5, some of among which are the multipliers of 25, or 125...
// Then we count the number of multipliers of 25, one 0 has been added during the last step.
// Then we count the nubmer of multipliers of 125, two 0s has been added during the last step.
