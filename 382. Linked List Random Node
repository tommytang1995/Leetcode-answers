 When I first got this question, I went through some articles, but it is painful for me to understand abstract notations like i, k, m, n, n-1, k+1...

After I read this one: http://blog.jobbole.com/42550/, it comes with a simple example and I understood suddenly, and write the code by myself. I translate it to English, so more people can benefit from it.

Start...
When we read the first node head, if the stream ListNode stops here, we can just return the head.val. The possibility is 1/1.

When we read the second node, we can decide if we replace the result r or not. The possibility is 1/2. So we just generate a random number between 0 and 1, and check if it is equal to 1. If it is 1, replace r as the value of the current node, otherwise we don't touch r, so its value is still the value of head.

When we read the third node, now the result r is one of value in the head or second node. We just decide if we replace the value of r as the value of current node(third node). The possibility of replacing it is 1/3, namely the possibility of we don't touch r is 2/3. So we just generate a random number between 0 ~ 2, and if the result is 2 we replace r.

We can continue to do like this until the end of stream ListNode.
